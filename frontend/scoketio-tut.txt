server side socket connection ->
installation -> npm i socket-io
then after this require this in our js file -> 
const io = require('socket.io')(port_number)
specify the port number where you want the server socket to be present and run , 

then connect the server side socket 
to do so -> 
io.on('connection',(socket)=>{
    console.log(socket.id); //this method will run everytime your client makes a request to the server , thus making the requests processing and handling faster (and realtime)

})


BUILDING THE CLIENT SIDE SOCKET IO ->
installation 
npm i socket.io-client 

then after this you will have to create a client side socket which is to be connected to the server side socket 
so ,
import {io} from "socket.io-client";
const socket  = io('http://localhost:port_number (of your server side socket where you have the server ) );


we need to make an auth middleware which has protect function inside it , which checks and prevents any unauthorized access of data by any registered user.
